## What You‚Äôre Flying

Recursive Control stitches together a **triad of agents**, a **modular plugin bay**, and **vision-assisted perception** so your instructions arrive as working Windows tasks.

| Layer | Callsign | Mission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| üß≠ Coordinator | Hermes | Interprets intent, selects strategy |
| üõ†Ô∏è Planner | Daedalus | Authors the execution playbook |
| ‚ö° Executor | Talos | Operates Windows actions through plugins |

Plugins extend the aircraft: keyboard and mouse automation, screen intelligence, PowerShell/CMD access, Playwright browser control, remote HTTP bridge, and more.

## Flight Patterns

```text
‚ÄúLaunch Excel, log in to Teams, and stage the daily report template.‚Äù
‚ÄúSweep Downloads, convert every .png into annotated documentation captures.‚Äù
‚ÄúOpen Chrome, authenticate into Jira, and create status tickets for each blocker.‚Äù
```

Every request is decomposed into atomic moves, verified, and streamed back with commentary.

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowdevs-io/Recursive-Control.git
