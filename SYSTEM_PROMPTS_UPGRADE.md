# System Prompts Upgrade - Computer Control Alignment

## Date: October 2, 2025

## Executive Summary

As an AI coding agent that regularly interacts with computers, I've upgraded Recursive Control's system prompts and multi-agent architecture to be significantly better aligned with **actual computer control workflows**.

### Key Philosophy Shift

**Before**: Prompts were generic, lacked computer-control specifics
**After**: Prompts are laser-focused on the observe → act → verify cycle

---

## Major Improvements

### 1. ✅ Window Handle Emphasis
**Problem**: AI was using global keyboard commands that went to random windows
**Solution**: Prompts now emphasize window-targeted methods throughout

```
OLD: "Send keys using SendKey()"
NEW: "ALWAYS use SendKeyToWindow(windowHandle, keys) with specific window handles"
```

### 2. ✅ Observation-First Approach
**Problem**: AI would act blindly without seeing current state
**Solution**: Prompts mandate starting with screenshots

```
Standard Workflow:
1. CaptureWholeScreen() - See what's there
2. ListWindowHandles() - Get window information
3. Plan based on observations
4. Execute with verification
```

### 3. ✅ Iterative Verification
**Problem**: AI would execute 10 steps blindly and fail
**Solution**: Prompts enforce step-by-step verification

```
Do → Verify → Adjust → Continue
Not: Plan 10 steps → Execute all → Hope it worked
```

### 4. ✅ Increased Iteration Limit
**Problem**: Complex tasks failed at 10 steps
**Solution**: Increased to 25 steps with better progress tracking

```
OLD: maxIterations = 10
NEW: maxIterations = 25 with "Step X/25" progress indicators
```

### 5. ✅ Better Error Handling Guidance
**Problem**: AI didn't know how to recover from failures
**Solution**: Prompts include specific error recovery patterns

```
Window Not Found:
1. ListWindowHandles() again
2. Check if window closed
3. If needed, launch application
4. Get new handle and retry
```

## New System Prompts

### Actioner Prompt (Single Agent Mode)

**Focus**: Direct computer control with full tool access

**Key Elements**:
- Complete tool catalog with window-targeted methods
- Operating principles (observation-first, window handles, verification)
- UI element format explanation (bbox coordinates)
- Workflow patterns for common tasks
- Best practices (DO/DON'T lists)

**Length**: ~400 lines (comprehensive but focused)

**Tone**: Direct, practical, action-oriented

### Coordinator Prompt (Multi-Agent Mode)

**Focus**: User interface and task routing

**Key Elements**:
- Decision tree for task complexity assessment
- Simple vs complex task differentiation
- Communication style guidelines
- Example interactions

**Length**: ~150 lines (concise, clear)

**Tone**: Friendly but professional

### Planner Prompt (Multi-Agent Mode)

**Focus**: Sequential breakdown and adaptive planning

**Key Elements**:
- Planning principles (observation-first, one action per step)
- Step format requirements
- Workflow pattern (receive → output first step → wait → adapt)
- Common task patterns (opening apps, browsing, UI interaction)
- Completion signal format

**Length**: ~250 lines (structured, methodical)

**Tone**: Analytical, step-by-step

## Prompt Comparison

### Old Actioner Prompt Issues:
```
❌ "Use available tools to accomplish the requested action"
   → Too vague, no specifics

❌ No mention of window handles
   → Led to SendKey() going to wrong windows

❌ No workflow guidance
   → AI didn't know to take screenshots first

❌ No UI element format explanation
   → AI confused about bbox coordinates
```

### New Actioner Prompt Strengths:
```
✅ "ALWAYS use SendKeyToWindow(windowHandle, keys)"
   → Clear, specific instruction

✅ Complete tool catalog with window-targeted methods
   → AI knows exactly what's available

✅ Standard workflow: Observe → Plan → Act → Verify
   → Clear execution pattern

✅ UI element format: "Element #1 at (150,200) [size: 120x40]"
   → AI understands the format

✅ BBox format: [left, top, right, bottom] with usage example
   → AI can use coordinates correctly
```

## Multi-Agent Improvements

### Iteration Loop Enhancements

**1. Increased Steps**:
```python
OLD: maxIterations = 10  # Too few for complex tasks
NEW: maxIterations = 25  # Handles multi-step workflows
```

**2. Better Progress Tracking**:
```
OLD: "Iteration 5 of 10"
NEW: "Step 5/25" with clearer context in prompts
```

**3. Enhanced Planner Feedback**:
```
OLD: "Here is the result: {result}"
NEW: "Step 5 Result: {result}
     
     Evaluate:
     1. Did this step succeed?
     2. Is overall task complete?
     3. If not, what's the next single step?"
```

**4. Clearer Actioner Instructions**:
```
OLD: "Execute the following step: {plan}"
NEW: "Execute this step: {plan}
     
     Remember to:
     1. Use window handles for keyboard/mouse
     2. Take screenshots to verify state
     3. Report exactly what you did and observed
     4. If something fails, explain what went wrong"
```

**5. Better Completion Detection**:
```python
OLD: if (plan.Contains("TASK COMPLETED"))
NEW: if (plan.IndexOf("TASK COMPLETED", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0 || 
         plan.IndexOf("Task completed", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0)
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Opening YouTube in Chrome

**Old Approach** (Often Failed):
```
1. SendKey("^t")  # Might go to wrong window!
2. SendKey("youtube.com")  # Might type in wrong place!
3. SendKey("{ENTER}")  # Who knows what this hit!
```

**New Approach** (Reliable):
```
1. CaptureWholeScreen() - See current state
2. ListWindowHandles() - Find Chrome (handle: 12345678)
3. ForegroundSelect("12345678") - Bring Chrome forward
4. SendKeyToWindow("12345678", "^t") - New tab in Chrome
5. SendKeyToWindow("12345678", "youtube.com") - Type URL
6. EnterKeyToWindow("12345678") - Navigate
7. Wait 2000ms
8. CaptureScreen("12345678") - Verify YouTube loaded
```

### Example 2: Finding UI Element and Clicking

**Old Approach** (Vague):
```
1. "Click the search button"  # Where? Which window?
```

**New Approach** (Specific):
```
1. CaptureScreen("12345678") - Get UI elements
2. Analyze elements:
   - Element #5 at (300,250) [size: 200x60]
   - This looks like the search box (large, top-center)
3. ClickOnWindow("12345678", [300, 250, 500, 310], true, 1)
4. CaptureScreen("12345678") - Verify search box focused
```

   "Find the weather in Tokyo and create a text file with the information"
   ```
   Expected: Should complete in 10-15 steps

3. **Window Targeting**:
   ```
   "Open Notepad and type 'Hello World'"
   ```
   Expected: Should use window handles, not global SendKey

4. **Error Recovery**:
   ```
   "Open a browser to nonexistent.local"
   ```
   Expected: Should detect error and explain what went wrong

5. **Multi-Step Browser**:
   ```
   "Search YouTube for Python tutorials and tell me the top 3 results"
   ```
   Expected: Should verify each step with screenshots

## Quick Start

### For AI Using This System

1. **Start with observation**: Always `CaptureWholeScreen()` first
2. **Use window handles**: Never use `SendKey()` without window handle
3. **Verify critical steps**: Take screenshots after important actions
4. **Work iteratively**: Don't plan 10 steps ahead, do 1 and verify
5. **Check browser state**: Always `IsBrowserActive()` before launching

### For Users

1. **Try simple tasks first**: "Open Chrome" or "Take a screenshot"
2. **Enable multi-agent for complexity**: Complex planning benefits from 3 agents
3. **Watch the progress**: UI shows "Step X/25" to track execution
4. **Be patient**: Quality execution takes time, especially with verification
5. **Provide feedback**: If something fails, the AI will explain what went wrong
