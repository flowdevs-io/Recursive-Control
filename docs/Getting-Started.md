# First Flight Checklist

Strap into Mission Control and run your first full-loop automation in under ten minutes.

## Cue the Agents

Once the cockpit is configured you can talk in plain-text, mission-style briefs.

### Launch Scripts

1. **File Ops Circuit**
   ```
   “Open File Explorer and navigate to my Documents folder.”
   “Create a new folder called Projects on my Desktop.”
   “Rename all .txt files in this folder to .md.”
   ```

2. **App Relay**
   ```
   “Open Notepad and type Hello World.”
   “Launch Chrome and navigate to github.com.”
   “Open Excel and create a new spreadsheet.”
   ```

3. **Vision Probe**
   ```
   “Take a screenshot of the current window.”
   “Capture the entire screen.”
   ```

4. **Browser Drone**
   ```
   “Open a browser and search for AI automation tools.”
   “Fill out this form with my information.”
   “Extract data from this webpage.”
   ```

## Meet the Crew

- **Hermes (Coordinator)** — interprets intent, sets the heading
- **Daedalus (Planner)** — drafts the maneuver plan step by step
- **Talos (Executor)** — performs every keystroke, click, and command

Agents talk to you in real-time so you can abort, adjust, or cheer as they work.

## Mission Briefing Tips

- **Paint the picture** → “Move all PDF files from Downloads to Documents” beats “Do something with files.”
- **Chunk the mission** → Run multi-stage workflows in segments and confirm each leg.
- **Talk human** → Natural language with intent and context works best; no scripting required.

## First-Time FAQs

**How do I know it’s engaged?**

Watch the live reasoning feed and action timeline.

**Something went sideways.**

Hit the abort control, then consult the [Troubleshooting Console](Troubleshooting.html).

Absolutely. Tweak prompts, toggle plugins, and save profiles.
