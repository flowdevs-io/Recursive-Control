Recursive Control is an innovative project designed to enable artificial intelligence (AI) to interact seamlessly with your computer, automating tasks, performing complex workflows, and enhancing productivity.

## Project Goal

Our mission is to create an AI-driven interface that can autonomously control your computer, intelligently perform tasks, open applications, execute commands, and streamline workflows, effectively turning natural language into actionable operations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Interaction**: Utilize AI models (such as GPT-based models) to interpret user input and intelligently execute actions.
- **Automated Workflow Execution**: Automate repetitive or complex sequences of computer actions.
- **Natural Language Commands**: Simply describe tasks in plain language, and let the AI handle execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 4.8 or later
- Windows Operating System
- Azure OpenAI API Key (More models will be supported in the future)

### Local Setup

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/flowdevs-io/Recursive-Control/releases) page and follow three easy steps.

1. Run recursivecontrol.exe
2. Setup your LLM

3. Input your commands directly into the UI, and watch as AI automate your tasks.


### Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flowdevs-io/Recursive-Control.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Recursive-Control
   ```

3. Restore dependencies and build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

## Plugin System

Recursive Control supports a modular plugin system, allowing you to extend its capabilities. Plugins can automate keyboard, mouse, window management, screen capture, command line, and more. You can find plugin implementations in the `FlowVision/lib/Plugins/` directory. To add your own plugin, implement the required interface and register it in the application.

### Built-in Plugins
- **CMDPlugin**: Execute Windows command line instructions.
- **PowershellPlugin**: Run PowerShell scripts and commands.
- **KeyboardPlugin**: Automate keyboard input.
- **MousePlugin**: Automate mouse actions.
- **ScreenCapturePlugin**: Capture screenshots.
- **WindowSelectionPlugin**: Select and interact with application windows.

## Folder Structure

FlowVision/                   # Main application source
  lib/                        # Core libraries and plugins
    Classes/                  # Helper and service classes
    Plugins/                  # Built-in plugins
    UI/                       # UI theming

  Properties/                 # .NET project properties
content/                      # Images and assets
```

## Example Use Cases=
- Control applications via natural language (e.g., "Open Excel and create a new spreadsheet")
- Capture and process screenshots for documentation
- Batch rename files or organize folders

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have .NET 4.8+ installed
- Check your API key and network connection for LLM access
- For plugin errors, review the application logs in %appdata%\FlowVision\plugin_usage.log
