<h1 align="center">ðŸ“Ž AI Control for Windows Computers ðŸ“Ž</h1>

Recursive Control is an innovative project designed to enable artificial intelligence (AI) to interact seamlessly with your computer, automating tasks, performing complex workflows, and enhancing productivity.

## Project Goal

Our mission is to create an AI-driven interface that can autonomously control your computer, intelligently perform tasks, open applications, execute commands, and streamline workflows, effectively turning natural language into actionable operations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Interaction**: Utilize AI models (such as GPT-based models) to interpret user input and intelligently execute actions.
- **Automated Workflow Execution**: Automate repetitive or complex sequences of computer actions.
- **Natural Language Commands**: Simply describe tasks in plain language, and let the AI handle execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 4.8 or later
- Windows Operating System
- Azure OpenAI API Key (More models will be supported in the future)
