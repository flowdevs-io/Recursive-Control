## üöÄ What is Recursive Control?

Recursive Control is an innovative project designed to enable artificial intelligence (AI) to interact seamlessly with your computer, automating tasks, performing complex workflows, and enhancing productivity through natural language commands.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Interaction**: Utilize AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to interpret user input and intelligently execute actions
- **Automated Workflow Execution**: Automate repetitive or complex sequences of computer actions
- **Natural Language Commands**: Simply describe tasks in plain language, and let the AI handle execution
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Sophisticated 3-agent system for planning, coordination, and execution
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Modular architecture supporting custom plugins

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Near-Term Goals
- [ ] Content warning logging for improved safety
- [ ] Expanded model support (Gemini, OLLAMA, Bedrock, Phi4)
- [ ] Improved speech recognition using real-time audio models

### Future Vision
- [ ] Local Bbox search for reduced token usage
- [ ] Managed LLM integration with subscription options
- [ ] YOLO Bbox parser integration for advanced vision

**End Goal**: Recursive Control on every Windows computer, leveraging local SLMs and embedded vision models. Making computer interaction so seamless that keyboards and mice become optional.
