# System Prompt Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The agents were having difficulty knowing how to use the tools to control the computer effectively. The previous system prompts lacked:
- Specific tool call formats and examples
- Common mistake warnings
- Step-by-step workflows
- Emphasis on mandatory practices (like using window handles)

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Added "Reset to Default" Buttons

Added reset buttons to the UI for all three agent prompts:
- **Actioner Tab**: "🔄 Reset to Default" button
- **Planner Tab**: "🔄 Reset to Default" button  
- **Coordinator Tab**: "🔄 Reset to Default" button

Each button:
- Shows confirmation dialog before resetting
- Reminds user to click "Save" after reset
- Loads default prompt from static methods

### 2. Completely Rewrote Actioner System Prompt

**New Features:**
- 📋 **YOUR MISSION section** - Makes it clear the agent DOES things, not just advises
- 🔧 **AVAILABLE TOOLS** - Complete tool reference with exact syntax
- 📋 **MANDATORY WORKFLOW** - Step-by-step process: Observe → Plan → Execute → Verify
- ✅ **EXAMPLES OF CORRECT USAGE** - 3 detailed examples:
  - Opening Notepad and typing
  - Clicking a button using bbox
  - Browser search automation
- ❌ **COMMON MISTAKES** - Shows wrong vs right approaches
- 🎓 **TOOL CALL FORMAT** - Exact format requirements
- 💡 **PRO TIPS** - Best practices checklist

**Key Improvements:**
- Emphasizes observation FIRST (CaptureWholeScreen before any action)
- Makes window handles MANDATORY for all keyboard/mouse operations
- Provides exact tool call syntax with examples
- Uses emojis for visual organization
- Shows step-by-step workflows for common tasks
- Warns about common pitfalls

**Length:** ~300 lines (vs ~80 lines previously)

### 3. Improved Planner System Prompt

**New Features:**
- Clear role explanation: "Output ONE step at a time"
- Iterative approach emphasized
- Good vs Bad step examples
- Common patterns library for:
  - Opening applications
  - Browser navigation
  - UI interaction
  - Typing text
  - File operations
- Critical reminders about window handles
- Example task breakdown showing one-step-at-a-time approach

**Key Improvements:**
- Emphasizes outputting single steps and waiting for results
- Provides template patterns for common tasks
- Shows complete example of breaking down a task
- Makes it clear to adapt based on actual results

**Length:** ~180 lines (vs ~70 lines previously)

### 4. Enhanced Coordinator System Prompt

**New Features:**
- Decision tree diagram
- Clearer task routing guidelines
- Communication style examples (good vs bad)
- Tone guidance for user-friendly responses

**Key Improvements:**
- Clearer distinction between simple/complex tasks
- Better examples of routing decisions
- Emphasis on user-friendly language vs technical jargon

**Length:** ~140 lines (vs ~60 lines previously)

### 5. Added Static Methods in ToolConfig

New methods to retrieve default prompts:
```csharp
ToolConfig.GetDefaultActionerPrompt()
ToolConfig.GetDefaultPlannerPrompt()
ToolConfig.GetDefaultCoordinatorPrompt()
```

These are used both for:
- Initial configuration (when creating new config)
- Reset buttons (to restore defaults)

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **`FlowVision/lib/Classes/ToolConfig.cs`**
   - Changed property initializers to use static methods
   - Added 3 new static methods with comprehensive default prompts
   - ~400 lines added

2. **`FlowVision/ToolConfigForm.cs`**
   - Added 3 reset button event handlers
   - Each shows confirmation and success messages
   - ~60 lines added

3. **`FlowVision/ToolConfigForm.Designer.cs`**
   - Added 3 button declarations
   - Added buttons to group box controls
   - Added button property definitions
   - ~50 lines added

## 🎓 Key Improvements for Tool Usage

### Before:
❌ Agents didn't know exact tool syntax
❌ Missing examples of correct usage
❌ No emphasis on observation-first approach
❌ Unclear about window handle requirements
❌ No common mistake warnings

### After:
✅ Exact tool call format with examples
✅ Step-by-step workflows for common tasks
✅ MANDATORY observation before action
✅ Clear emphasis on window handles
✅ Common mistakes section with wrong vs right
✅ Pro tips and best practices
✅ Visual organization with emojis
✅ Iterative approach explained clearly

## 💡 Expected Impact

Agents should now:
1. **Always start with observation** (CaptureWholeScreen first)
2. **Use correct tool syntax** (with all required parameters)
3. **Include window handles** for all keyboard/mouse operations
4. **Follow proper workflows** (observe → plan → execute → verify)
5. **Avoid common mistakes** (outlined in prompts)
6. **Work iteratively** (one step at a time, adapt based on results)
