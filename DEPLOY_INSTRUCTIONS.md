## üîß Action Required to Deploy

The documentation is ready but needs to be deployed. Choose ONE option:

### Option 1: Merge docs branch to master (Recommended)

This will use the current GitHub Pages configuration:

```bash
# From the docs branch
git checkout master
git merge docs
git push origin master
```

The site will auto-deploy to: https://flowdevs-io.github.io/Recursive-Control/

### Option 2: Reconfigure GitHub Pages to use docs branch

1. Go to: https://github.com/flowdevs-io/Recursive-Control/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `docs`
   - **Folder**: `/docs`
3. Click **Save**
4. Site will deploy in 2-5 minutes
