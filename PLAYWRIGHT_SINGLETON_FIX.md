# Playwright Singleton Pattern Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Browser was launching fresh every time, even within the same conversation.

**Root Cause:** The `PlaywrightPlugin` was being instantiated as a new object on every AI call:
```csharp
// OLD - Creates new instance each time
tools.AddRange(PluginToolExtractor.ExtractTools(new PlaywrightPlugin()));
```

This meant:
- `_browser` variable was null on every call
- No memory of previous browser instance
- Sessions couldn't be maintained
- User had to log in repeatedly

## ✅ Solution: Singleton Pattern

**Fix:** Implemented singleton pattern to maintain ONE instance across all calls:
```csharp
// NEW - Uses same instance every time
tools.AddRange(PluginToolExtractor.ExtractTools(PlaywrightPlugin.Instance));
```

Now:
- ✅ Same browser instance persists
- ✅ Memory maintained across calls
- ✅ Sessions automatically reused
- ✅ Login once, stay logged in

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Added Singleton Pattern to PlaywrightPlugin

```csharp
internal class PlaywrightPlugin 
{
    // Singleton instance
    private static PlaywrightPlugin _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    // Instance variables persist across calls
    private IPlaywright _playwright;
    private IBrowser _browser;
    private IBrowserContext _context;
    private IPage _page;
    // ... other state variables

    // Public static property
    public static PlaywrightPlugin Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    if (_instance == null)
                    {
                        _instance = new PlaywrightPlugin();
                    }
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }

    // Private constructor
    private PlaywrightPlugin()
    {
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated All Actioners

**Files Modified:**
- `Actioner.cs`
- `MultiAgentActioner.cs`
- `LMStudioActioner.cs`

**Change:**
```csharp
// Before
new PlaywrightPlugin()

// After
PlaywrightPlugin.Instance
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### First Call
```
AI receives: "Navigate to LinkedIn"
↓
PlaywrightPlugin.Instance (creates if null)
↓
Launches browser → Navigates → Saves session
↓
Browser remains open
```

### Second Call (Same Conversation)
```
AI receives: "Take a screenshot"
↓
PlaywrightPlugin.Instance (returns existing instance)
↓
_browser != null → Uses existing browser! ✓
↓
Takes screenshot → Auto-saves session
```

### Third Call (Different Conversation, Same App Session)
```
AI receives: "Navigate to another page"
↓
PlaywrightPlugin.Instance (returns existing instance)
↓
_browser != null → Uses existing browser! ✓
_context has saved session → Already logged in! ✓
↓
Navigates → Auto-saves session
```

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### Before (New Instance Each Time)
```
Call 1: new PlaywrightPlugin() → _browser = null → Launch new browser
Call 2: new PlaywrightPlugin() → _browser = null → Launch new browser AGAIN ❌
Call 3: new PlaywrightPlugin() → _browser = null → Launch new browser AGAIN ❌
```

### After (Singleton Instance)
```
Call 1: PlaywrightPlugin.Instance → _browser = null → Launch new browser
Call 2: PlaywrightPlugin.Instance → _browser exists → Use existing! ✓
Call 3: PlaywrightPlugin.Instance → _browser exists → Use existing! ✓
```

## 🎁 Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Browser Reuse** | Same browser across multiple commands |
| **Session Persistence** | Login state maintained automatically |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Only one browser instance |
| **Better Performance** | No repeated browser launches |
| **Seamless UX** | User doesn't see multiple browsers |

## 🔍 Thread Safety

The singleton implementation is **thread-safe** using double-check locking:

```csharp
if (_instance == null)           // First check (fast path)
{
    lock (_lock)                  // Acquire lock
    {
        if (_instance == null)    // Second check (synchronized)
        {
            _instance = new PlaywrightPlugin();
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Only one instance ever created
- ✅ Thread-safe initialization
- ✅ Minimal locking overhead
- ✅ No race conditions

## 📖 Usage Example

### Scenario: LinkedIn Workflow

**Command 1:**
```
You: "Navigate to https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"
AI: Launches browser, navigates
    [Browser stays open]
```

**Command 2 (User manually logs in):**
```
You: "I logged in, take a screenshot"
AI: Uses SAME browser instance ✓
    Takes screenshot
    Auto-saves session with login
```

**Command 3:**
```
You: "Click on the first post"
AI: Uses SAME browser instance ✓
    Already logged in! ✓
    Clicks element
    Auto-saves session
```

**Command 4 (Later or different conversation):**
```
You: "Go to LinkedIn"
AI: Uses SAME browser instance ✓
    Already logged in! ✓
    Navigates
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Still launching new browser"

**Check:**
1. Make sure app is using the built version
2. Restart the application completely
3. Check browser is from singleton:
   ```
   You: "What's the browser status?"
   AI: Should show "BrowserActive: Yes"
   ```

### "Want to force a new browser"

**Solution:**
```
You: "Close the browser"
[Then next command will launch fresh]

Or:

You: "Launch browser, force new"
[Explicitly requests new browser]
```

### "Singleton not working across app restarts"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Singleton persists: **Within app session** ✓
- Sessions persist: **Across app restarts** ✓
- Browser instance: **Does NOT survive app restart** (normal)

When app restarts:
- New singleton instance created
- Browser will launch fresh
- BUT saved sessions are restored! ✓

## 🎯 Key Points

1. **Singleton = Same Instance** - One PlaywrightPlugin instance for entire app lifetime
2. **Auto-Save = Sessions Persist** - Login states saved across app restarts
3. **Combined Effect** - Browser reused during session, login restored on restart

## ✨ Summary

The singleton pattern ensures:
- ✅ **One browser instance** during app runtime
- ✅ **State maintained** across multiple AI calls
- ✅ **Sessions saved** automatically
- ✅ **Logins persist** across app restarts
- ✅ **Better performance** - no repeated launches
- ✅ **Seamless UX** - feels like natural browsing

**Result:** Log in once, browse naturally, everything just works! 🎉
