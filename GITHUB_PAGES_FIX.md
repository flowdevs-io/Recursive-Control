# GitHub Pages Build Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The error `No such file or directory @ dir_chdir0 - /github/workspace/docs` has been resolved.

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

**Problem 1: Theme Configuration**
```yaml
# ❌ Old (doesn't work with GitHub Actions)
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

# ✅ New (works with GitHub Pages)
remote_theme: pages-themes/cayman@v0.2.0
```

**Problem 2: Missing YAML Front Matter**
- Documentation files need front matter for Jekyll to process them
- Each page needs layout and title specified

**Problem 3: Plugin Configuration**
- Used plugins that aren't in GitHub Pages whitelist
- Needed to specify `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Updated `_config.yml`

**Changed to:**
```yaml
title: Recursive Control Documentation
description: AI-Powered Computer Control for Windows
baseurl: "/Recursive-Control"
url: "https://flowdevs-io.github.io"

remote_theme: pages-themes/cayman@v0.2.0

plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-sitemap

markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  input: GFM
  hard_wrap: false
  syntax_highlighter: rouge

show_downloads: false
```

### 2. Added YAML Front Matter to All Pages

**Every .md file now has:**
```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Page Title
---
```

**Files updated:**
- ✅ index.md (Home)
- ✅ Installation.md
- ✅ Getting-Started.md
- ✅ Multi-Agent-Architecture.md
- ✅ API-Reference.md
- ✅ FAQ.md
- ✅ Troubleshooting.md

### 3. Fixed Plugin List

Only using GitHub Pages whitelisted plugins:
- `jekyll-remote-theme` (for Cayman theme)
- `jekyll-seo-tag` (for meta tags)
- `jekyll-sitemap` (for sitemap.xml)

## 🔍 Verify Build Success

### Check Actions Tab

1. Go to repository **Actions** tab
2. Look for latest workflow run
3. Should show: ✅ **pages build and deployment**
4. Click to see details

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Build successful
✅ Deploy successful
🌐 Published to: https://flowdevs-io.github.io/Recursive-Control/
```

### If Build Still Fails

**Check:**
```bash
# Ensure all files have YAML front matter
head -5 docs/Installation.md
# Should show:
# ---
# layout: default
# title: Installation
# ---

# Verify _config.yml is valid YAML
cat docs/_config.yml | yaml-lint
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing front matter: Add to all .md files
- Invalid YAML: Check for tabs (use spaces)
- Wrong branch: Must be `main` or `master`
- Wrong folder: Must be `/docs`

## 🎯 What Changed

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Theme | `theme:` (local) | `remote_theme:` (GitHub) |
| Plugins | Custom list | Whitelisted only |
| Front matter | Missing | All pages have it |
| baseurl | Not set | `/Recursive-Control` |
| url | Not set | Full GitHub Pages URL |

---

## 💡 Alternative: Minimal Theme

If you prefer a simpler theme, change in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
# Cayman (current, colorful)
remote_theme: pages-themes/cayman@v0.2.0

# OR Minimal (clean, simple)
remote_theme: pages-themes/minimal@v0.2.0

# OR Slate (dark theme)
remote_theme: pages-themes/slate@v0.2.0

# OR Architect (modern)
remote_theme: pages-themes/architect@v0.2.0
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "unknown tag 'seo'"

**Solution:** Ensure `jekyll-seo-tag` is in plugins:
```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag
```

### Pages Don't Style Correctly

**Solution:** Check baseurl in `_config.yml` matches repo name:
```yaml
baseurl: "/Recursive-Control"  # Must match repo name exactly
```

### 404 on All Pages

**Solution:** 
1. Verify index.md exists (not just Home.md)
2. Check GitHub Pages is enabled
3. Wait for build to complete (Actions tab)
4. Clear browser cache

### Links Don't Work

**Solution:** Use relative links without baseurl:
```markdown
✅ [Installation](Installation.md)
❌ [Installation](/Recursive-Control/Installation.md)
```

Jekyll handles baseurl automatically.
